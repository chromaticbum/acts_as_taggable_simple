ActsAsTaggableSimple
====================

This gem was build because other solutions to adding in tagging
functionality were either outdated or too complex for most
simple needs.

ActsAsTaggableSimple adds #acts_as_taggable to ActiveRecord::Base.
When called, this method will add in a has_many :taggings and
has_many :tags, :through => :taggings relationship to the model.

tag_list and tag_list= methods are also defined in order to
see and update the tags on the model.

tag_list returns an array of strings of the tags.
tag_list= takes a string of tags separated by spaces.

This plugin leaves all of the custom computations, such as cloud
calculations to the user and is meant to only provide the most
basic framework for tags.


Example
=======

app/models/taggable_model.rb

class TaggableModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_taggable
end


rails console

t = TaggableModel.new :tag_list => "rails css javascript"
t.save
t.tag_list # returns ["rails", "css", "javascript"]
t.tag_list = "rails html js"
t.save
t.tag_list # returns ["rails", "html", "js"]
# note that #tag_list is updated immediately after setting
# it, while #tags and #taggings are only updated after
# saving the model
